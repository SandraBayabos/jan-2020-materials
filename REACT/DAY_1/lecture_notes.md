### ES6

1. What is ES6

- Ecma Script 2015

2. Changes in ES6

- Variables
  => var to const and let
  => const and let create block scope variables so anything within {} like in a for loop, won't be able to be accessed outside, whereas var can kind of bleed outside

- String concatenation
  => using backticks is also an ES6 thing, which allows us to interpolate variables into our strings

### INTRODUCTION TO JQUERY

1. What is Jquery?

- It is a Javascript library that helps you to write shorter code. It's especially useful for selecting, styling and running animation-type functions
- You need to import Jquery into your file before you can start using it!
- No real best-practice about combining jquery and javascript together so do so if you need to or find certain things easier to do in vanilla JS as compared to Jquery
